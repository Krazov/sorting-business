# Sorting business

Repo dedicated to testing the speed of different sorting algorithms. Without any plan so far so project does only this and nothing more.

## Running test

Run `node ./test.js` in console of your chosen flavour while being in repo’s only folder. That’s on PC. On mac you have to manage on your own.
